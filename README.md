Airspace of Germany in OpenAir Format

This repository contains the airspace of Germany as published by the originl author under
https://www.daec.de/fachbereiche/luftraum-flugsicherheit-betrieb/luftraumdaten/

As this way of publication does not show any changes and does not allow for collaboration
I set up this repository to re-publish it for easy access to the open source community.

It gets automatically updated by a GitHub workflow once a day, so it should be always up to date.
If you want to publish any changes, you can either send them to the original author mentioned
in the airspace file or issue a pull request on this repository. I will try to forward your changes
to the author of the airspace file.

Hopefully, he will use GitHub or something similar to publish this on his own in the future.
